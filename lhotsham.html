            <p>Dzongkhags: Samtse, Sarpang, Tsirang. </p>
            <p>Lhotshampas speak Nepali as their first language. In southern Bhutan, Nepali used to be taught in the school and was spoken and written in these areas. However, this changed during the 1980s when there was racial conflict between Nepali in Bhutan and Bhutanese. Since then, Nepali is only taught in the home and has become a spoken language in Bhutan. Thus, some Nepali speakers from southern Bhutan cannot read or write in Nepali. Currently, Nepali is the first language for most southern Bhutanese and most people use it in their home. Also, Nepali is most commonly used in school outside of the classes.</p>

            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>The Lhotshampa, who live mainly in the south of the country, are the third largest group in Bhutan. Originally from Nepal, they speak Nepali and most practice Hinduism. People of Nepalese origin had migrated to Bhutan from the end of the 19th century as contractual workers. Thus lhotshampa usually prefers to eat Indian style of food. Specifically, most Lhotsampas will not touch or eat beef or pork, as this is considered a sin in the Hindu religion. It is therefore essential to be respectful of these dietary restrictions when counseling Lhotsampa patients about nutrition. In addition, when religion prohibits touching beef or pork, work in meat processing plants is not feasible. Some members of the younger generation may not adhere to these restrictions.</p>
            <p>Traditional marriages took place between members of the same caste and were arranged by the parents of the bride and groom. Traditional weddings are great celebrations. Families spend up to a month preparing food and drink, including rice, lentils, a kind of sweetened bread that resembles a doughnut, and a special kind of pickle, called dhulae achar.</p>
